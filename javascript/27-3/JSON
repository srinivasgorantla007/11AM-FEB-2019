JSON : 

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.

 It is easy for humans to read and write. 

 It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.

JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. 

These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
